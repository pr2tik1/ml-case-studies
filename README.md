# Machine Learning Models 

The repository maintained to keep pracitce over the wide range of machine learning models used in predictive analysis, Data Science and various appllications. This repository contains the implementation of Machine Learning models using python and its libraries.The models are developed from scratch as well as using the Scikit-learn Library for better understanding.

### The libraries used are:
  - Scikit-Learn
  - Numpy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Plolty-express
  
  
  
 ***This is currently under development.***

    - TODO :
        - K-means
        - K nn
        - Naive Bayes
        - XGBoost
        - SGD Classifier
