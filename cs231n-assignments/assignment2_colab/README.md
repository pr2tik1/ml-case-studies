### Goals

In this assignment you will practice writing backpropagation code, and training Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

- Understand **Neural Networks** and how they are arranged in layered architectures.
- Understand and be able to implement (vectorized) **backpropagation**.
- Implement various **update rules** used to optimize Neural Networks.
- Implement **Batch Normalization** and **Layer Normalization** for training deep networks.
- Implement **Dropout** to regularize networks.
- Understand the architecture of **Convolutional Neural Networks** and get practice with training them.
- Gain experience with a major deep learning framework, such as **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch**.
