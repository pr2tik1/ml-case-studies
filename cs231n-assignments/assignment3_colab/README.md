### Goals

In this assignment, you will implement recurrent neural networks and apply them to image captioning on the Microsoft COCO data. You will also explore methods for visualizing the features of a pretrained model on ImageNet, and use this model to implement Style Transfer. Finally, you will train a Generative Adversarial Network to generate images that look like a training dataset!

The goals of this assignment are as follows:

- Understand the architecture of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and how they operate on sequences by sharing weights over time.
- Understand and implement both Vanilla RNNs and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
- Understand how to combine convolutional neural nets and recurrent nets to implement an image captioning system.
- Explore various applications of image gradients, including saliency maps, fooling images, class visualizations.
- Understand and implement techniques for image style transfer.
- Understand how to train and implement a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to produce images that resemble samples from a dataset.
