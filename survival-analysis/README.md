# Kaplan-Meier Estimate
Kaplan-Meier analysis measures the survival time from a certain date to time of death, failure, or other significant events. It is also known as the product-limit estimator, which is a non-parametric statistic used to estimate the survival function from lifetime data. To know more about it, visit the blog [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-kaplan-meier-estimator-68258e26a3e4).
